# Snake AI

AStar based Snake AI agent running on Löve2D framework.

The code is written in MoonScript -- dynamic scripting language that compiles into Lua. It is highly recommended to read only *.moon files because exported *.lua files tend to be harder to read.

The main part of the project is implemented in astar.moon file.

## Running the Project

To run the project, Löve2D interpreter is required and can be downloaded from [the website](https://love2d.org/#download).

After installing the interpreter, the code can be run by calling
```
$ love .
```
in the project folder.

Keep in mind that love.exe usually needs to be added to PATH manually.
